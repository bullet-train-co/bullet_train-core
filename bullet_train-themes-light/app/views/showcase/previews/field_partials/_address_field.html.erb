  When you're building forms, use Bullet Train's Field Partials for your form fields. They DRY-up all the presentation logic without needing a third-party dependency like Formtastic.

  <br/>
  Read much more about them in the extensive <a href="https://bullettrain.co/docs/field-partials" target="_blank">developer documentation</a>.

<% form_with model: Scaffolding::CompletelyConcrete::TangibleThing.new, url: "#" do |form| %>
  <% showcase.sample "Basic" do %>
    <%
      # super scaffolding will add a `set_default_{address_field_name}` to your controller, so this isn't needed
      form.object.address_value = Address.new
    %>
    <%= render 'shared/fields/address_field', form: form, method: :address_value %>
  <% end %>

<%# To display further options use `showcase.options.x` as options with a block will clear the old options. See `_options.html.erb` for an example. %>
<% showcase.options do |o| %>
  <% o.required :form, "Reference to the form object", type: "ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder" %>
  <% o.required :method, "Attribute of the model" %>
