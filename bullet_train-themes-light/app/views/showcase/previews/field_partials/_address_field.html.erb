  Read much more about them in the extensive <a href="https://bullettrain.co/docs/field-partials" target="_blank">developer documentation</a>.

  <% showcase.sample "Basic" do %>
    <%= render 'shared/fields/address_field', form: form, method: :address_value %>
  <% end %>

  <% o.required :method, "Attribute of the model" %>
