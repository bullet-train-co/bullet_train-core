    # cancancan's `load_and_authorize_resource` method, which is awesome, but it also
    # implements a lot of the options required to make that method work very well for our
    # controllers in the account namespace, including our shallow nested routes.
    #
    # there are also some complications that were introduced into this method by our support
    # for namespaced models and controllers. (we introduced this complexity in support of
    # namespacing our `Oauth::` models and controllers.)

    # and `model` is something like `project`.
