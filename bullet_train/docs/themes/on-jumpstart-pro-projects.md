# Installing Bullet-Train Themes on Jumpstart PRO Projects

Bullet Train themes can be installed on Jumpstart PRO projects, giving you native `erb` partials and Hotwire-powered UI components.

Like Jumpstart PRO, Bullet Train themes are built using `tailwindcss` and use `esbuild` and `postcss` for JavaScript and style sheets.

To get a quick sense of the UI components, we encourage you to spin up a Bullet Train project and navigate through the screens to create a "Creative Concept" and "Tangible Thing" resources.

Note: we also have [instructions for installing themes on other Rails projects](on-other-rails-projects.md).
