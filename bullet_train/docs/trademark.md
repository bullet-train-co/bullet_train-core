# Trademark Information

"Bullet Train" is a registered trademark of Bullet Train, Inc.

We love and encourage contributions to the Bullet Train ecosystem. That's our dream!

It's also important when you're building packages or presenting offerings in the Bullet Train ecosystem, they're not named in such a way that anyone could confuse your package or offering as being officially maintained or sanctioned by the Bullet Train team.

Here are some examples of names we would not typically object to:

 - "Super Widget __for Bullet Train__"
 - "MySQL Starter Kit __for Bullet Train__"
 - "__BT__ Starter Kit with MySQL"
 - "__BT__ Pro Tools"

Here are some examples that would require explicit permission:

 - "Bullet Train Super Widget"
 - "Bullet Train MySQL Starter Kit"
 - "Bullet Train Application Template with MySQL"
 - "Bullet Train Pro Tools"
 - "Bullet Train Conference"
 - "Bullet Train Podcast"

If you've got an idea and aren't sure about the name, message Andrew Culver privately [on Discord](https://discord.gg/gmfybM8kA6) or [via Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/andrewculver). If you know anything about trademarks, you know we're required to enforce our policies, so thank you for understanding! üôè
