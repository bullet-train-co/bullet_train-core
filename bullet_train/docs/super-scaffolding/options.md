# Super Scaffolding Options

There are different flags you can pass to the Super Scaffolding command which gives you more flexibility over creating your model. Add the flag of your choice to **the end** of the command for the option to take effect.
```
rails generate super_scaffold Project Team description:text_field --sortable
```

Most of these include skipping particular functionalities, so take a look at what's available here and pass the flag that applies to your use-case.
