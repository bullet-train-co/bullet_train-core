    If you're upgrading `bullet_train-*` Ruby gems and you run into any new
    issues, you should probably also pull in updates from the Bullet Train
    starter repository into your local application, just to make sure
    everything is synced up. See https://bullettrain.co/docs/upgrades for
    details.
