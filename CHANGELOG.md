### Changes

Prior to Version 1.3.1 we weren't really tracking changes.

Sorry about that! ðŸ˜¬ We're gonna start doing better.

Now the best way to track changes is with the GitHub Releases.

https://github.com/bullet-train-co/bullet_train-core/releases

Whenever a new version is relased that page will be automatically updated
and you can drill down on any release to see a full diff of everything
that changed since the last release.
