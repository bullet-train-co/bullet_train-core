Description:
  Generate the setup and configuration for using an external OAuth Provider.

  For a list of readily available provider strategies, see https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies

Example:
  E.g. what we actually did to start Shopify off:
    bin/rails generate bullet_train:oauth_provider omniauth-shopify-oauth2 shopify Oauth::ShopifyAccount SHOPIFY_API_KEY SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_KEY --icon=ti-shopping-cart
    (Please note here that the SHOPIFY_API_KEY and SHOPIFY_API_SECRET_KEY strings are not the actual values, just the names we give to the environment variables.)
