Description:
  Generate a handler for incoming webhooks from an outside source.

Example:
  E.g. prepare to receive system-level webhooks from ClickFunnels
    rails g bullet_train:incoming_webhooks ClickFunnels

  This will create:
    app/models/webhooks/incoming/click_funnel_webhook.rb
    app/controllers/webhooks/incoming/click_funnel_webhooks_controller.rb
    test/controllers/webhooks/incoming/click_funnel_webhooks_controller_test.rb
  And update:
    config/routes.rb

üèÜ Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.
