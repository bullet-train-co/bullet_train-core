Description:
  Generate an action that targets on model.

Example:
  E.g. Perform a schedulable action named Publish for one Listing.
    rails generate super_scaffold:action_models:targets_one Publish Listing Team

  This will create:
    app/avo/resources/listings_publish_action.rb
    app/controllers/account/listings/
    app/controllers/api/v1/listings/
    app/controllers/avo/listings_publish_actions_controller.rb
    app/models/listings.rb
    app/models/listings/
    app/views/account/listings/publish_actions/
    app/views/api/v1/listings/publish_actions/
    config/locales/en/listings/
    db/migrate/20240109095227_create_listings_publish_actions.rb
    test/controllers/api/v1/listings/
    test/factories/listings/
    test/models/listings/
  And update:
    app/models/listing.rb
    app/views/account/listings/show.html.erb
    config/models/roles.yml
    config/routes.rb
    config/routes/api/v1.rb

🏆 Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.
