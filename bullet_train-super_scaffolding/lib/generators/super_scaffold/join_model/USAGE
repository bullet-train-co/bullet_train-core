Description:
  Generate a Bullet Train Join Model.

Example:
  E.g. Add project-specific tags to a project:

  Given the following example models:

    rails g super_scaffold Project Team name:text_field description:trix_editor
    rails g super_scaffold Projects::Tag Team name:text_field

  1Ô∏è‚É£  Use the standard Rails model generator to generate the join model:

    rails g model Projects::AppliedTag project:references tag:references

    üëã Don't run migrations yet! Sometimes Super Scaffolding updates them for you.

  2Ô∏è‚É£  Use `join-model` scaffolding to prepare the join model for use in `crud-field` scaffolding:

    rails g bullet_train:join_model Projects::AppliedTag project_id{class_name=Project} tag_id{class_name=Projects::Tag}

  3Ô∏è‚É£  Now you can use `crud-field` scaffolding to actually add the field to the form of the parent model:

    rails g super_scaffold:field Project tag_ids:super_select{class_name=Projects::Tag}

    üëã Heads up! There will be one follow-up step output by this command that you need to take action on.

  4Ô∏è‚É£  Now you can run your migrations.
