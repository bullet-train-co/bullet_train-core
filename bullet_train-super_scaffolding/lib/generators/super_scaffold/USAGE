Description:
  Generate a production ready CRUD interface for a model. See the docs for more details:
  https://bullettrain.co/docs/super-scaffolding

  E.g. a Team has many Sites with some attributes:
    rails g super_scaffold Site Team name:text_field url:text_area

  E.g. a Section belongs to a Page, which belongs to a Site, which belongs to a Team:
    rails g super_scaffold Section Page,Site,Team title:text_field body:text_area

  E.g. an Image belongs to either a Page or a Site:
    Doable! See https://bit.ly/2NvO8El for a step by step guide.

  E.g. Pages belong to a Site and are sortable via drag-and-drop:
    rails g super_scaffold Page Site,Team name:text_field path:text_area --sortable

Example:
  E.g. a Team has many Projects each having a name:
  bin/rails generate super_scaffold Project Team name:text_field

  This will create:
      app/controllers/account/projects_controller.rb
      app/controllers/api/v1/projects_controller.rb
      app/models/project.rb
      app/views/account/projects/
      app/views/api/v1/projects/
      config/locales/en/projects.en.yml
      db/migrate/20231004190209_create_projects.rb
      test/controllers/api/v1/projects_controller_test.rb
      test/factories/projects.rb
      test/models/project_test.rb

üèÜ Protip: Commit your other changes before running Super Scaffolding so it's easy to undo if you (or we) make any mistakes.
If you do that, you can reset to your last commit state by using `git checkout .` and `git clean -d -f`.

Give it a shot! Let us know if you have any trouble with it! ‚úåÔ∏è
